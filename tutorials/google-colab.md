## Introduction

**Google Colaboratory** (**Colab**) is a free cloud service provided by Google Research that allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser. It provides access to computing resources, including GPUs, suitable for various tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, and running Python scripts. Since Colab is based on Jupyter, it supports many Python libraries and tools.

### Key features

- Seamless Collaboration: Enables real-time sharing and collaborative work, similar to Google Docs.
- Easy Integration with Google Drive: Allows you to store and access your notebooks directly from Google Drive.
- Compatibility with Python and its Libraries: Colab supports Python and its extensive ecosystem of libraries, making it suitable for a wide range of tasks.

## Creating your first Colab notebook

### Step 1: Open Google Drive

1. Go to the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/home) page (<https://drive.google.com/drive/home>).
2. Make sure you are signed in with your **ualberta.ca** account.

### Step 2: Install the Google Colab app

1. Select "My Drive" on the left panel, then click "My Drive" on the top of the main panel.
2. On the opened menu, click "More".
3. Open the menu and click "More". If you see "Google Colaboratory" in the submenu, you can proceed to [Step 3](#step-3-create-a-new-colab-notebook). Otherwise, click "Connect more apps" on the submenu.

8. After installation, make sure that you have selected **Google Colaboratory** as the default app for files it can open, and click "Ok".

9. Press "Done" and close the Google Workspace Marketplace window.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Google Colab.

### Step 3: Create a new Colab notebook

A *notebook* is an interactive document that contains code cells and text cells. Code cells are where you write and run Python code, while text cells are where you write explanatory comments or instructions.

To get started with a new Colab notebook:

1. Open the main menu on "My Drive" and click "More".
2. Select "Google Colaboratory" from the opened submenu.

![Alt text](figures/s10.jpeg)

3. You have now created a new Colab notebook. To edit the title, click on it and type "hello.ipynb". This name has the "ipynb" extension, which stands for Interactive Python Notebook. Jupyter Notebook uses this format to store documents.

![Alt text](figures/s11.jpeg)

4. The notebook contains a single empty code cell. You can execute Python code or shell commands using code cells. For example, let's write a simple code that prints "Hello, World!". First, click on the code cell and write the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

5. To run the code in a cell, click the Play ‚ñ∂ button at the top left corner of the code cell, or press *Ctrl + Enter*. This will execute the code and display the output below the cell.

![Alt text](figures/s12.jpeg)

- Running the above code will display "Hello, World!" in the output cell.

![Alt text](figures/s13.jpeg)

6. Now, let's add a text cell to the notebook. You can do this by clicking on the *+Text* button on the top bar or hovering your mouse over the current cell and selecting the *+Text* button.

![Alt text](figures/s14.jpeg)

7. Creating a text cell opens a text editor where you can write and format your text using markdown syntax. Next to your text, you can see a preview of the text cell.

![Alt text](figures/s15.jpeg)

- Colab notebooks can also run shell commands. Running shell commands allows you to execute commands from the operating system, such as installing packages, managing files, or accessing system information, without leaving the Colab notebook.

8. To see how it works, click on the *+Code* button on the top bar or hover your mouse over the last cell and select the *+Code* button.

![Alt text](figures/s16.jpeg)

9. Shell commands are preceded by an `!`. For example, `!pwd` prints the current working directory path. Let's check the Python version by writing the following command in the code cell you just created:

```bash
!python --version
```

10. This will display the version of Python being used, for example, `Python 3.10.12`.

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first Colab notebook. You can save your file by pressing *Ctrl + S* on your keyboard or by selecting *Save* from the *File* menu.

![Alt text](figures/s18.jpeg)

- The File menu offers other useful options such as *Locate in Drive* and *Save a copy in Drive*.
  - *Locate in Drive*: This option opens a new tab in your browser and shows you the location of the current Google Colab file in your Google Drive. You can then navigate to other folders or files in your Google Drive, or perform actions such as renaming, moving, copying, or deleting the file.
  - *Save a copy in Drive*: This option creates a duplicate of the current Google Colab file and saves it in your Google Drive. You can then choose a name and a location for the copy, or share it with others. This is useful if you want to keep a backup of your work, work on different versions of the same file, or share the current version with others.

## Exploring the Files panel

The Files panel allows you to organize and access your files.

1. Locate the "hello.ipynb" in your Google Drive and Open it in Google Colab.

> *Note*: You can open an IPYNB file located in Google Drive by double-clicking on it or selecting *Open with > Google Colaboratory* from the right-click menu.

2. Click on the folder üìÅ icon on the left panel to open The Files panel.

![Alt text](figures/s20.jpeg)

- The Files panel displays the files in the "/content" folder of your Google Colab space. You can access these files in your notebooks.

3. To upload files to this folder, click on the "Upload" button at the top of the panel. You can also use the right-click menu of the Files panel to upload files, create a new file, or create a new folder.

![Alt text](figures/s21.jpeg)

4. To download a file from your Colab space, click on the file name in the Files panel and select "Download".

![Alt text](figures/s22.jpeg)

- Google Colab also allows you to mount Google Drive to your Colab space, enabling you to access, import, and export your Google Drive files directly from your Colab notebook. This also syncs your Colab space and your Google Drive.

5. To mount Google Drive click on the "Mount Drive" button at the top of the Files panel.

![Alt text](figures/s23.jpeg)

6. A new popup window will ask for your permission to access your Google Drive. Choose "Connect to Google Drive".
7. A sign in window will show up. Pick your account from ualberta.ca.
8. After that, you will see a new folder "drive" in the Files panel. Open the "MyDrive" folder inside "drive" to view your Google Drive files.
