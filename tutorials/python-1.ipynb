    "# Part I: Welcome to Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is known for its simplicity and readability. It is used in a wide range of fields, including web development, data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to learn: Python is known for its clear and concise syntax, making it easier to understand and write even for those without extensive programming experience.\n",
    "- Powerful libraries: Python has a vast collection of libraries and modules that extend its functionality, including those you'll use for optimization and data manipulation.\n",
    "- Interpreted language: Python runs the code line by line without compiling it first.\n",
    "- Free and open-source: Python is available for free under an open-source license, meaning it can be used and modified by anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic typing: You do not need to declare variable types explicitly, which can make coding more flexible.\n",
    "- Object-oriented programming: Python supports OOP concepts like classes and objects, but it also allows procedural and functional programming styles.\n",
    "- Extensive standard library: Python comes with a rich collection of built-in modules and functions for common tasks, saving you time and effort.\n",
    "- Vast third-party ecosystem: There is a huge repository of additional libraries and modules available for Python, expanding its capabilities even further.\n",
    "- Cross-platform: Python code can run on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hello World!\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
