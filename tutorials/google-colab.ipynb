    "\n",
    "**Google Colaboratory** (**Colab**) is a free cloud service by Google Research that lets you write and run Python code in your browser. With Colab, you can access GPUs and other computing resources for large-scale data analysis and machine learning. Colab is based on Jupyter, so you can use many Python libraries and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seamless Collaboration: Share and work with others in real-time, like Google Docs.\n",
    "- Easy Integration with Google Drive: Store and access your notebooks from Google Drive.\n",

    "\n",
    "A *notebook* is an interactive document that contains code cells and text cells. Code cells are where you write and run Python code, while text cells are where you write explanatory comments or instructions. For a sample notebook, see the [Colab overview](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, go to [Colab website](https://colab.research.google.com/) and login with your Google account.\n",
    "Click on the *File* menu above and select *New notebook* to create a new notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a new notebook from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/home) page by clicking on *New*, then *More*, then *Google Collaboratory*. This will open a new notebook with the default Colab toolbar and an empty code cell. You can now start writing Python code in it that will execute on Colab's cloud backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note*: If you do not see the *Google Collaboratory* option in the *New* menu, you need to connect the app first. To do so, click on *Connect more apps* via *New > More*. This opens the *Google Workspace Marketplace* window. Search for *Collaboratory* and install *Colaboratory* (by *Colaboratory team*)."

    "## Installing Python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will use various Python packages to perform data manipulation, data analysis, data visualization, and numerical optimization.\n",
    "Python packages (or libraries) are collections of modules that provide specific functions or features. We can install and import these packages directly in our Google Colab notebooks to use them in our code. Below are some popular packages we will use and their purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data handling and analysis**: These packages enable working with diverse data types like arrays, data frames, or time series. They also facilitate tasks like cleaning, processing, aggregating, and manipulating data. Key packages include:\n",
    "  - *NumPy*: Supports for multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions and operations on them. NumPy is ideal for scientific computing needs like creating/manipulating arrays, linear algebra, and mathematical applications.\n",
    "  - *Pandas*: Offers high-performance data structures and analysis tools for tabular data. Its DataFrame can store/process data in rows and columns with multiple methods for indexing, filtering, grouping, and reshaping. Pandas allows reading, writing, and exploring data from sources like CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.\n",
    "- **Data visualization**: These packages help us to create and display graphical representations of data, such as charts, plots, or maps. They also enable customizing the appearance, style, and interactivity of the visualizations. The following key packages provide a variety of plots that are suitable for exploring and understanding data.\n",
    "  - *Matplotlib*: Leading Python plotting library to create and adapt figures, axes and other plot elements. It supports diverse plot types including bar, pie, scatter, histograms etc. We will employ Matplotlib for basic data visualization needs.\n",
    "  - *Seaborn*: High-level statistical data visualization build on Matplotlib. Seaborn Integrates well with Pandas offering enhanced, informative plots like heatmaps, boxplots etc. to represent data.\n",
    "- **Numerical optimization**: These packages help us to formulate and solve optimization problems, such as linear programming, integer programming, or nonlinear programming. They also provide tools for modeling, solving, and analyzing the results of the optimization problems. Some of the packages that we will use for this purpose are:\n",
    "  - *pyomo*: A Python-based open-source software for modeling and solving optimization problems. It supports a variety of problem types, such as linear, quadratic, nonlinear, mixed-integer, stochastic, and bilevel programming. It also supports a variety of solvers, such as GLPK, Gurobi, IBM Cplex, and more. We will model optimization problems in Pyomo leveraging its algebraic modeling capabilities.\n",
    "  - *glpk*: A free software for solving large-scale linear programming and mixed integer programming problems. It implements the simplex method, the interior-point method, and the branch-and-cut method. It also provides a standalone solver that can be called from the command line or from other programs. GLPK offers Python APIs to interface optimization problems.\n",
    "  - *gurobipy*: A Python interface for Gurobi, one of the leading commercial solvers that can handle various optimization problems, such as linear programming, mixed-integer programming, and quadratic programming. The GurobiPy package Provides Python binding to formulate and solve problems. We will use GurobiPy to integrate Gurobi with Pyomo.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note*: Commercial solvers like Gurobi usually have a free license installed by default for solving small-to-medium scale optimization problems. However, if you want to solve large-scale problems you need to obtain a Web License Service (WLS) license to work with Google Colab, which is free for academic purposes.
